The Satellite Technology Development Programme (STDP) is a comprehensive initiative designed to foster innovation, support research and development, and accelerate the growth of Singapore's satellite technology ecosystem.

In 2024, OSTIn has secured an additional $60M to advance technological innovation. From 2025 onwards, STDP 2.0 will continue to support the development of space technologies that are important to national imperatives and/ or economic interest.

The STDP comprises three distinct funding archetypes, each tailored to address specific stages of technology development and industry needs:

These schemes aim to offer focused and expeditious support, enabling more flexible, efficient and targeted support to nurture a thriving space technology sector in Singapore.

Key areas of focus include Remote Sensing and Satellite Communications. However, OSTIn is also exploring new opportunities emerging in the space economy, such as on-orbit servicing, in-space manufacturing and space life sciences, including whether Singaporeâ€™s strengths in domains like AI, robotics, materials science and life sciences can be pivoted to support space applications.

### **Application Process**

STDP is open for local Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL), Research Institutions (RI), and industry partners. Interested foreign entities must seek local partners. The Application Process for each Archetype is as follows:

**Archetype 1: Technology Development**

This Archetype is for applicants seeking to develop space technologies & capabilities to address business or national needs, with a clear plan to delivery.
