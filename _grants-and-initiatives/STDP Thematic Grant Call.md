<p><strong><u>Grant Call Brief Details</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Exploitation of Earth Observation Data</strong>
<br>Earth observation data has become a crucial tool in addressing sustainability
and humanitarian challenges, particularly in disaster response and maritime
operations. By providing comprehensive and timely information about our
planet, these technologies enable us to monitor, understand, and respond
to changes more effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In disaster response, real-time satellite imagery allows for rapid assessment
of affected areas, facilitating quicker and more targeted emergency interventions,
whilst historical data helps in predicting and mitigating future risks.</p>
<p>For maritime operations, Earth observation data supports critical activities
such as optimising ship routing, enhancing port security, and detecting
illegal fishing or oil spill incidents. This wealth of information not
only improves operational efficiency and safety at sea but also contributes
significantly to maritime law enforcement and environmental protection
efforts.</p>
<p>For this grant call brief, we have identified the following key research
themes to brief participants on the specific problem statements and envisaged
requirements of the proposed solutions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All-Weather &amp; Accurate Anomaly Detection for Maritime Needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disaster assessment and prediction for HADR needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These themes aim to leverage Earth observation data for sustainability
and humanitarian applications, with an emphasis on advanced data analysis
techniques including artificial intelligence (AI). Key objectives include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Developing advanced AI and machine learning algorithms to automate the
detection, analysis, and prediction of sustainability-related phenomena.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhancing data fusion techniques to integrate Earth observation data with
other relevant data sources (e.g., ground-based sensors, socio-economic
data) for more detailed and timely insights for decision-making.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Duration</strong>
<br>The project duration, including completion of the final report and all
miscellaneous project activities, shall not exceed one (1) year. Proposals
requesting support for longer than the stipulated number of years may be
submitted. However, when compared with proposals of similar quality, these
will be given lower priority. Strong justifications for the longer development
period must be provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Eligibility and Funding Support&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This call is open to public research entities
in Singapore, including Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), public sector
agencies and Research Institutes (RIs). The main Researcher or Principle
Investigator (PI) shall hold a full-time appointment in an eligible R&amp;D
organisation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public research entities in Singapore can qualify
for up to 100% funding support of approved qualifying direct costs of a
project. Support for indirect costs is only allowed for Singapore-based
IHLs<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and
A*STAR RIs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public research entities in Singapore may collaborate
with researchers in private companies, overseas universities, or other
local IHLs and public sector RIs companies and research partners not based
in Singapore;</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All research work must be done in Singapore,
unless approved by OSTIn.</p>

<p><strong>Industry Relevance (Economic potential)</strong>
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grant applicants proposing projects that are
more downstream in nature (e.g. projects leading to the actual development
of new products, software, and services) are <strong><u>required</u></strong> to
have the support of an industry partner<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a> in
project execution. Projects with a greater degree of industry support and
collaboration (i.e. industry co-investment, industry partnerships, pathways
to commercialization) are preferred. Researchers are required to clearly
state the nature and degree of their proposed collaboration with industry.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Projects that are more upstream in nature and
oriented around fundamental research should also clearly articulate the
pathways to commercialization and/or government use cases for the proposed
research to be undertaken.</p>
<p><strong>Application and Evaluation Process:</strong>
</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In response to the OSTIn Request for
Proposal, Lead PIs of proposed projects are invited to submit Full Proposals
using the Proposal Template. CVs and references may be attached as annexes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All shortlisted Full Proposals will then be
forward to the OSTIn Project Evaluation Panel (PEP) for evaluation. Shortlisted
applicants may be invited to attend the PEP meeting to present their proposal
to the PEP and to provide clarifications to the PEP’s queries.</p>
<p><strong>Submission</strong>
</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals must be submitted to the RFP OIC
using the Proposal Template via email with the Subject Title format: “STDP-Title
of Theme-Institution &amp; Department of Applicant“. Please refer to <strong><u>Annex A</u></strong> for
the list of available theme(s).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Result</strong>
</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortlisted applicants with applications to
be evaluated by the PEP will be notified no later than <strong>3 months from the Closing Date for RFP.</strong> We
