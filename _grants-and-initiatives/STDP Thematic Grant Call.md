<p><strong><u>Grant Call Brief Details</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Exploitation of Earth Observation Data</strong>
<br>
<br>Earth Observation data has become a crucial tool in addressing sustainability
and humanitarian challenges, particularly in disaster response and maritime
operations. By providing comprehensive and timely information about our
planet, these technologies enable us to monitor, understand, and respond
to changes more effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In disaster response, real-time satellite imagery allows for rapid assessment
of affected areas, facilitating quicker and more targeted emergency interventions,
whilst historical data helps in predicting and mitigating future risks.</p>
<p>For maritime operations, Earth Observation data supports critical activities
such as optimising ship routing, enhancing port security, and detecting
illegal fishing or oil spill incidents. This wealth of information not
only improves operational efficiency and safety at sea but also contributes
significantly to maritime law enforcement and environmental protection
efforts.</p>
<p>For this grant call brief, we have identified the following key research
themes to brief participants on the specific problem statements and envisaged
requirements of the proposed solutions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Disaster assessment and prediction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vessel identification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oil spill detection</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These themes aim to leverage Earth observation data for sustainability
and humanitarian applications, with an emphasis on advanced data analysis
techniques including artificial intelligence (AI). Key objectives include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Developing advanced AI and machine learning algorithms to automate the
detection, analysis, and prediction of sustainability-related phenomena.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhancing data fusion techniques to integrate Earth observation data with
other relevant data sources (e.g., ground-based sensors, socio-economic
data) for more detailed and timely insights for decision-making.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Duration</strong>
</p>
<p>The project duration, including completion of the final report and all
miscellaneous project activities, shall not exceed one (1) year. (Proposals
requesting support for longer than the stipulated number of years may be
submitted. However, when compared with proposals of similar quality, these
will be given lower priority. Strong justifications for the longer development
period must be provided.)</p>
