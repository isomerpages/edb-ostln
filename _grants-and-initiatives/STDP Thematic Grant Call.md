<p><strong><u>Grant Call Details</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Program Intent</strong>
<br>The Biomass Digital Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) Grant Call supports Singapore's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 through the development of dMRV methodologies incorporating satellite remote sensing data/solutions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This program aims to support Singapore's strategic need to secure high integrity carbon offsets annually by 2050, while positioning the nation as a leading Geospatial Centre for Southeast Asia and the Equatorial Belt.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Alignment</strong>
<p>This initiative directly supports Singapore's national climate objectives by:</p>

- Enhancing the integrity and transparency of carbon offsets critical to Singapore's net-zero pathway.</p>
- Positioning Singapore as a leading Geospatial Centre for Southeast Asia and the Equatorial Belt.</p>
- Supporting sustainability agendas and sustainable development whilst creating economic opportunities in green finance and technology sector.</p>

<p><strong>Target Ecosystems</strong></p>

- Green Carbon Systems: Carbon stored in terrestrial forests and vegetation across Southeast Asia, including above-ground and below-ground biomass in forests, plantations, and other vegetated areas.
- Blue Carbon Systems: Carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrass beds, and seaweed habitats.

<p><strong>Technical Requirements</strong></p>

- Proposals must demonstrate satellite remote sensing as the core technology for biomass monitoring and address measurable performance indicators including:
- Accuracy improvements in biomass estimation
- Temporal and Spatial resolution capabilities  
- Demonstration of AI/ML model performance with validated datasets and uncertainty quantification

<p><strong><u>Eligible Applicants</u></strong></p>

1. <strong>Primary Applicants</strong>: Local Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and Research Institutes (RIs) are eligible to serve as lead applicants.
2. <strong>Industry Participation</strong>: Industry applicants must partner with local IHLs/RIs as co-applicants. Industry partners* may include technology companies, carbon project developers, satellite operators, EO data providers and environmental consulting firms.

<p>*International collaborations are encouraged but must demonstrate clear value to Singapore’s remote sensing capabilities, which should originate from Singapore.</p>
