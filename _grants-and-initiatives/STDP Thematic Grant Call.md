<p><strong><u>Grant Call Details</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>Program Intent</strong></p>

The Biomass Digital Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) Grant Call supports Singapore's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 through the development of dMRV methodologies incorporating satellite remote sensing data/solutions. 

This program aims to support Singapore's strategic need to secure high integrity carbon offsets annually by 2050, while positioning the nation as a leading Geospatial Centre for Southeast Asia and the Equatorial Belt.

<p><strong>Strategic Alignment</strong></p>

This initiative directly supports Singapore's national climate objectives by:

- Enhancing the integrity and transparency of carbon offsets critical to Singapore's net-zero pathway
- Positioning Singapore as a leading Geospatial Centre for Southeast Asia and the Equatorial Belt
- Supporting sustainability agendas and sustainable development whilst creating economic opportunities in green finance and technology sectors

<p><strong>Target Ecosystemst</strong></p>

- Green Carbon Systems: Carbon stored in terrestrial forests and vegetation across Southeast Asia, including above-ground and below-ground biomass in forests, plantations, and other vegetated areas.
- Blue Carbon Systems: Carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrass beds, and seaweed habitats.

<p><strong>Technical Requirementst</strong></p>

- Proposals must demonstrate satellite remote sensing as the core technology for biomass monitoring and address measurable performance indicators including:
- Accuracy improvements in biomass estimation
- Temporal and Spatial resolution capabilities
- Demonstration of AI/ML model performance with validated datasets and uncertainty quantification

<p><strong><u>Eligible Applicants</u></strong></p>

1.	Primary Applicants: Local Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and Research Institutes (RIs) are eligible to serve as lead applicants.
2.	Industry Participation: Industry applicants must partner with local IHLs/RIs as co-applicants. Industry partners* may include technology companies, carbon project developers, satellite operators, EO data providers and environmental consulting firms.
   
*International collaborations are encouraged but must demonstrate clear value to Singapore’s remote sensing capabilities, which should originate from Singapore.

<p><strong>Proposal Requirements</strong></p>

- Applications must be submitted as a Letter of Intent following the prescribed template structure, consisting of a cover page (excluded from page limit) and a maximum 5-page response 

<p><strong>Collaboration Incentives</strong></p>

Additional evaluation points will be awarded for:

- Partnerships with relevant stakeholders across the carbon credit ecosystem (e.g., project developers, registries, Validation and Verification Bodies (VVBs), etc.)
- Collaborations with research institutions from countries that have signed Article 6 agreements with Singapore
- Demonstrated clear pathways for commercial deployment within 3-5 years post-project completion

<p><strong>Submission Process</strong></p>

- Applications to be submitted electronically through the OSTIn website (www.space.gov.sg)
