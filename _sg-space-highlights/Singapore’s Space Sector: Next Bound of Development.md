<p>As Singapore continues to advance our position as a global hub for innovation
and technology, space will be part of our vision for the future. <em>Singapore’s Space Sector: Next Bound of Development</em> announced
at the Global Space Technology Convention &amp; Exhibition (GSTCE) on <strong>26 February 2025</strong> sets
out how Singapore will address the priorities of strengthening our national
capabilities in space, and creating pathways for Singapore to participate
in and contribute to the rapidly growing global space economy.</p>
<h4><strong>Singapore: The Place for Space</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Our Journey</strong>
<br>Singapore’s space journey dates back several decades with the installation
of our first satellite ground station on Sentosa in 1971 and the launch
of our first communications satellite in 1998. &nbsp;The Office for Space
Technology &amp; Industry, Singapore (OSTIn) was established in 2013 to
drive the development of small satellite capabilities, with an expanded
mandate in 2020 to develop Singapore’s space industry, foster innovation,
and grow international partnerships.</p>
<p>As a leading global hub for businesses and space-adjacent sectors such
as aerospace, microelectronics and precision engineering, Singapore is
well placed to capitalise on global momentum in the space sector. This
includes the use of space technologies to enhance communications and connectivity
services, as well as to drive innovation in the green and digital economy,
strengthening Singapore’s business competitiveness.</p>
<p><em>Singapore’s Space Sector: Next Bound of Development</em> articulates
the next stage of Singapore’s space journey as we amplify our national
pursuit to harness the tremendous potential of space technologies and unlock
new opportunities in the space economy.</p>
