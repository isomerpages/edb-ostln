<p>The Space Technology Development Programme (STDP) will be enhanced with
an additional investment of S$60 million over the next two years, as announced
by DPM Gan Kim Yong at the Global Space Technology Convention &amp; Exhibition
2025 earlier today. This aims&nbsp;to accelerate innovation in satellite
technology, foster capability-building in Singaporeâ€™s IHLs and RIs and
promote the commercialization of research.</p>
<p>The STDP is a comprehensive initiative designed to foster innovation,
support research and development, and accelerate the growth of Singapore's
space technology ecosystem. Since 2022, the Government has set aside over
S$200 million to support space projects through STDP. Companies, universities,
and research institutions are welcome to apply.</p>
<p>The STDP comprises three distinct funding archetypes, each tailored to
address specific stages of technology development and industry needs.</p>
