Although Singapore's space ecosystem is relatively nascent, its growth is accelerating and the organizations involved have made great strides in expanding their areas of expertise. Singapore's space sector comprises over 2,000 professionals and researchers working in over 60 companies active in different sections of the entire value chain -  from design and manufacturing to satellite based services such as data processing.

For more information on some of these companies and organizations, please download a copy of our corporate brochure [here](/about-us/brochure/).

The rapid growth of our space ecosystem can be attributed to some of the advantages that Singapore brings. Namely:

- Skilled and motivated workforce
- Ease of doing business due to open and fair regulations that protects intellectual property and business interests and connectivity to the rest of the world
- Culture that embraces innovation, poised to take advantage of or create the next disruptive technology
