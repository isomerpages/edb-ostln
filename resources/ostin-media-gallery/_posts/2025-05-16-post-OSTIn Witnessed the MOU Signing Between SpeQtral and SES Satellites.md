<p>OSTIn’s Executive Director, Mr. Jonathan Hung, witnessed the Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) signing between <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/speqtral/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SpeQtral</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ses/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SES Satellites</a></strong>.
The collaboration between both parties marks a significant milestone in
Singapore's quantum technology landscape that will strengthen the security
of global communications in the future. The MOU signed in March 2025 leverages
SpeQtral’s strengths as one of the first quantum key distribution (QKD)
companies, together with SES’s satellite QKD expertise and position as
a global content and connectivity solutions provider - to make quantum
communications more accessible worldwide and allow seamless services for
end-users in Asia and Europe.&nbsp;🛰️
