<p>The 7th edition of the @Singapore Space Symposium (SSS) was successfully
held on 25 February 2025. The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nus-cde/" class="EsZtTLoFIUAUIwpVUZrTgOCpNfIJUjpMMI" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">NUS College of Design &amp; Engineering</a> Faculty&nbsp;was
abuzz with more than 400 attendees from 25 countries and more than 18 institutes.
Participants gathered for discussions and sharings among our space technology
community.&nbsp;🌌
<br>
<br>They were engaged with cutting-edge research sharings, networking with
industry leaders, and witnessed the innovative work of our institutions
and agencies&nbsp;through poster presentations and exhibition booths. ☄️
<br>
<br>In his Keynote Address, OSTIn's Deputy Chairman Mr. Quek Gim Pew, said
that&nbsp;the public sector aims to take on a catalysing role to facilitate
the growth of a sustainable space ecosystem.&nbsp;One of our key initiatives
is the Space Technology and Development Programme (STDP), which seeds research
into critical space domain areas important to Singapore and other countries.
This programme exemplifies the government’s commitment to accelerating
innovation and fostering collaboration in the space sector. 🌟
<br>
<br>Many of our young students in Singapore also participate in hands-on satellite
building projects – examples include students from the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nushigh/" class="EsZtTLoFIUAUIwpVUZrTgOCpNfIJUjpMMI" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">NUS High School of Mathematics &amp; Science</a> who
have built a nanosatellite and the NUS team that is building the GALASSIA-5
satellite, aimed at enhancing Singapore’s capabilities to respond to disasters
and provide humanitarian aid.&nbsp;These opportunities demonstrate Singapore’s
commitment to building the talent pipeline and exposing students to the
exciting world of the space industry.&nbsp;🚀
<br>
<br>Over 20 speakers presented the latest developments of their work, covering&nbsp;four
themes: Earth Observation for Sustainability, Unlocking Very Low Earth
Orbit and Resilient Satellites, Next Generation Satellite Communications,
and Innovations in Artificial Intelligence for Space Autonomy. 🌏
<br>
<br>If you missed the chance to be there today, fret not – we will be back
next year for the Singapore Space Symposium in 2026! 🛰️
<br>
<br>OSTIn's new initiatives will help expand Singapore’s space ecosystem to
deliver impactful space-related innovations and solutions to the world
with the support of our local and international partners.
<br>
<br>The future of space is one of limitless possibilities. Singapore is ready
to play an active role in shaping this exciting frontier and in so doing,
create new opportunities for our economy, society, and globally.</p>
<p></p>
