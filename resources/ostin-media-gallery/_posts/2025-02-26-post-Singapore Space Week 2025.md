<p>The 7th edition of the Singapore Space Symposium (SSS) was successfully
held on 25 February 2025. The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nus-cde/" class="EsZtTLoFIUAUIwpVUZrTgOCpNfIJUjpMMI" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">NUS College of Design &amp; Engineering</a> Faculty&nbsp;was
abuzz with more than 400 attendees from 25 countries and more than 18 institutes.
Participants gathered for discussions and sharings among our space technology
community.
<br>
<br>In his Keynote Address, OSTIn's Deputy Chairman Mr. Quek Gim Pew, said
that&nbsp;the public sector aims to take on a catalysing role to facilitate
the growth of a sustainable space ecosystem.&nbsp;One of our key initiatives
is the Space Technology and Development Programme (STDP), which seeds research
into critical space domain areas important to Singapore and other countries.
This programme exemplifies the governmentâ€™s commitment to accelerating
innovation and fostering collaboration in the space sector.</p>

<p>Many of our young students in Singapore also participate in hands-on satellite
building projects â€“ examples include students from the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nushigh/" class="EsZtTLoFIUAUIwpVUZrTgOCpNfIJUjpMMI" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">NUS High School of Mathematics &amp; Science</a> who
have built a nanosatellite and the NUS team that is building the GALASSIA-5
satellite, aimed at enhancing Singaporeâ€™s capabilities to respond to disasters
and provide humanitarian aid.&nbsp;These opportunities demonstrate Singaporeâ€™s
commitment to building the talent pipeline and exposing students to the
exciting world of the space industry.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Over 20 speakers presented the latest developments of their work, covering&nbsp;four
themes: Earth Observation for Sustainability, Unlocking Very Low Earth
Orbit and Resilient Satellites, Next Generation Satellite Communications,
and Innovations in Artificial Intelligence for Space Autonomy.
<br>
<br>Singapore Space Symposium will be back in 2026 with another round of cutting-edge
space research panel discussions and sharings by our industry experts.</p>

in satellite technology, foster capability-building in Singaporeâ€™s IHLs
and RIs, and promote the commercialisation of research.
<br>
<br>The STDP is a comprehensive initiative designed to foster innovation,
support research and development, and accelerate the growth of Singapore's
space technology ecosystem. Since 2022, the Government has set aside over
S$200 million to support space projects through STDP. Companies, universities,
and research institutions are welcome to apply.

<p>The Earth Observation Initiative (EOI) is a collaborative effort spearheaded
by Singapore's Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn). Launch
on 26 February 2025, the EOI aims to harness the power of Earth observation
to address pressing sustainability and humanitarian challenges across the
Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Recognising that the challenges confronting the Asia-Pacific region are
too complex and broad for any single stakeholder to address effectively,
the EOI brings together a diverse ecosystem of partners, including intergovernmental
entities, research institutions, and industry players. This collaboration
aims to develop innovative solutions that are deployable, adoptable, and
implementable, and scalable for the region, making a tangible impact on
regional issues.</p>
