<p>OSTIn is partnering with the <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-office-for-outer-space-affairs/" class="pcwxHzJDNtENtbMWLKRJNYNnhxmaIdvrpU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA)</a></strong> on
the "𝗦𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝘄 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗦𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀" project as
part of ongoing efforts to create an enabling environment for space activities
in Singapore. Through this collaboration, Singapore aims to explore the
key elements of national space legislation as a first step to developing
a comprehensive policy framework that will strengthen our position as a
responsible spacefaring nation while building up our space sector.
<br>
<br>We look forward to engaging stakeholders to develop a future-ready regulatory
environment to better support innovation and growth in the space ecosystem.</p>
