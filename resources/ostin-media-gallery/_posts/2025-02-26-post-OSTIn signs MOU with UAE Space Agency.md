<br>The MOU between UAESA and OSTIn on Cooperation in Space Research and Space
Activities for Peaceful Purposes establishes a common framework for bilateral
cooperation. It reflects our mutual interest in the field of exploration
and use of outer space for peaceful purposes.
<br>
<br>Our potential collaborations include space science technology and applications,
promotion of space industry, and academic partnerships. This will create
new possibilities such as the recently announced partnership between ST
Engineering and EDGE to advance the UAE's synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
satellite capabilities. Link: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ostinsingapore/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://lnkd.in/gfFNDPE4<br></a>
