<p>We clocked a week of great milestones hosting the 33rd ASEAN Sub-Committee
on Space Technology and Applications (SCOSA) in Singapore. A vital platform
to deepen regional collaboration in space technology and explore new areas
of partnership, this SCOSA also welcomed Timor-Leste joining for the first
time as observers.</p>

<p>In addition, we successfully concluded the ASEAN Space Policy Expert Exchange
Seminar, co-organised with the Secure World Foundation. The seminar brought
together key thought leaders, including Dr. Umamaheswaran, Chair of the
UN COPUOS Working Group on the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space,
Ms. Hazuki Mori (World Economic Forum), and Mr. RJ Stensland (LeoLabs),
to discuss space sustainability and situational awareness. Together, we
explored strategies for implementing space sustainability practices through
national policies and regulations, ensuring that ASEAN continues to harness
the benefits of space technology for generations to come.</p>

<p>Capping off the week was an official dinner co-hosted with NUS CRISP,
for the SCOSA delegates and seminar participants to foster stronger ties
and further discussions on ASEANâ€™s pivotal role in advancing space sustainability.
<br>
<br>A big thank you to all delegates, experts, and participants for making
this week a resounding success! We look forward to building on this momentum
to take our region to even greater heights.</p>
