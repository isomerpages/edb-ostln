<p>Whilst in Milan for the 75th International Astronautical Congress (IAC),
we took a quick trip to Luxembourg to visit <a href="https://www.ses.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SES</a>, a leading satellite communications
company, along with our colleagues from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
and <a href="https://speqtralquantum.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SpeQtral</a>,
a Singaporean company with expertise in Quantum Key Distribution.</p>
<p>We had a good exchange of views on respective priorities for SES, Singapore,
and Singapore’s space industry, and discussed how we could work together
in Europe and APAC. We were also treated to a lovely tour by our hosts,
who brought us around SES' antenna farm.</p>

<p>Did you know: SES' HQ is located on castle grounds. The Château de Betzdorf
was a gift from The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in the 1980s. Today, high
tech satellite operations occur amidst a historic setting - a good metaphor
for the continuous innovation in the space sector.</p>
