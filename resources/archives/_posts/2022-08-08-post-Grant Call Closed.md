The latest grant call is now closed. We thank all who have submitted their whitepaper for evaluations.

OSTIn will evaluate the submissions over the next 4 weeks and shortlisted applicants will be asked to submit a full proposal. 

Please note that shortlisted applicants are not guaranteed funding as the project move on to the final round of evaluation by a panel of experts.
