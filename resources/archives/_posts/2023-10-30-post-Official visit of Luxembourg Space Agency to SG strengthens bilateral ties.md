1 Nov 2023, Singapore – The Office for Space Technology & Industry, Singapore (OSTIn) is pleased to announce the successful visit of the Luxembourg Space Agency (LSA) and 12 Luxembourgish space entities to Singapore.  

During the visit, the delegation from LSA, led by CEO Marc Serres, engaged in various activities. Highlights included:

1. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Signing

This MOU facilitates both parties to further explore collaboration in research, capability development, industry promotion and international space policy. The signing ceremony took place at the Luxembourg-Singapore Space Forum, where LSA CEO Marc Serres and OSTIn Acting Executive Director Ronald Tong expressed their commitment to strengthening ties, laying the foundation for future collaborations in space. The signing was witnessed by Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce President, Fernand Ernster, Luxembourg Ambassador, Patrick Hemmer, and OSTIn’s Deputy Chairman, Mr. Quek Gim Pew.

2. Luxembourg-Singapore Space Forum

OSTIn and LSA also co-organised a Space Forum, which provided valuable networking and pitching opportunities for 24 space entities from both countries. The event featured presentations by both OSTIn and LSA, shedding light on their respective space ecosystems, innovations and collaboration possibilities. The gathering provided an unprecedented platform for companies to connect and explore potential partnerships. 

3. Company visits

Facilitated by OSTIn, the Luxembourg delegation visited Singtel, SpeQtral and ST Engineering in Singapore. The purpose was to explore business opportunities and encourage collaboration in space. The productive discussions helped set the stage for potential cooperation that could further solidify our friendly relations. 

This MOU signing and exchanges opened a new chapter of friendship between OSTIn and LSA. We are confident that our commitment to work more closely together will lead to mutually beneficial outcomes.
