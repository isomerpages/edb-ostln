Singapore Space & Technology Ltd , our ecosystem development partner, and OSTIn are delighted to co-organise a Singapore space industry engagement and a student engagement session with Mr Robinson. 

During the industry engagement, Mr Robinson spoke about the role Singapore and its industry could play in the global space ecosystem, and encouraged the industry stakeholders to find “our niche in the global space ecosystem”. 

During his engagement with students, Mr Robinson inspired our youths about STEM and the future of space through his sharing on how the JWST was launched and deployed.
