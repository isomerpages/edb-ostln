15 Feb 2023, Singapore - The Office for Space Technology &amp; Industry, Singapore (OSTIn) and the Geo-
Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) of Thailand
signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today to galvanise space
cooperation between both countries.

The MOU provides a framework for OSTIn-GISTDA to work closely together on earth
observation (EO) applications, research collaborations, space policy exchanges,
industry promotion, as well as efforts in Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics (STEM), and space education. 

The new agreement builds upon
existing OSTIn-GISTDA cooperation on space-related projects at the ASEAN Sub-
Committee for Space Technology and Applications (SCOSA). These projects include
the sharing of information on satellite assembly, integration and testing facilities.

Under the MOU, OSTIn and GISTDA will exchange information, share best
practices, jointly train specialists, hold joint seminars and workshops, and promote
STEM and space-related subjects to the younger generation. In addition, both
agencies will explore how they can further contribute to regional space
developments, including but not limited to projects at SCOSA. 

For example, OSTIn
and GISTDA will explore cooperating in EO with the services provided by
Singapore’s NeuSAR satellite. NeuSAR is a high-performance small satellite that
can capture images during both day and night, even when there is heavy cloud
cover, rainfall or haze.

The MOU was signed by Mr David Tan, Executive Director of OSTIn, and Dr Pakorn
Apaphant, Ph.D., Executive Director of GISTDA, at the Global Space Technology
Convention 2023 in Singapore.

“OSTIn and GISTDA share the mutual belief that space technologies and
applications can be harnessed for the collective betterment and benefit of
humankind. We look forward to working even more closely with GISTDA to
strengthen our respective space ecosystems and spur cooperation between
Thailand and Singapore,” said Mr Tan.

Dr Pakorn added: “We are very excited that a new dawn of space cooperation between Thailand and Singapore has finally happened. Both countries will not only benefit from this MOU, but we can also extend our effective collaboration to the Southeast Asian region. Our new EO satellites THEOS-2 and NeuSAR are great examples of the value that we can contribute to the global space community. Together, we can expand the regional value of space industry and economy to the next level.”
