It has been a most fruitful [#IAC2022](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=iac2022&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6978964084364869632) for the OSTIn team, with a whirlwind of meetings over the past week which we hope will lead to enhanced ties with our counterparts 🚀  
  
In the final days of [IAC 2022 - Space for All](https://www.linkedin.com/company/iac2022/), OSTIn Executive Director Mr [David Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAYQza8Bfu9F-9R6pdbxl8KW7a0LEhZIYGk) held bilateral meetings with counterparts from [GISTDA (Geo-informatics and Space Technology Development Agency)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gistda-geo-informatics-and-space-technology-development-agency-/), [Israel Space Agency](https://www.linkedin.com/company/israel-space-agency/), [JAXA: Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jaxanasdanalisas/), [Luxembourg Space Agency](https://www.linkedin.com/company/luxembourg-space-agency/) and [UK Space Agency](https://www.linkedin.com/company/uk-space-agency/). Earlier in the week, he also met counterparts from the [Australian Space Agency](https://www.linkedin.com/company/australian-space-agency/), [European Space Agency - ESA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-space-agency/), [Philippine Space Agency](https://www.linkedin.com/company/philspaceagency/), [Türkiye Uzay Ajansı](https://www.linkedin.com/company/t%C3%BCrkiye-uzay-ajans%C4%B1/), and the [UAE Space Agency](https://www.linkedin.com/company/uae-space-agency/). It was great to be able to meet everyone again in person and to renew old ties and build new ones!  
  
Besides meeting space agency counterparts, the OSTIn delegation also met with more than 15 space companies. The Singapore Pavilion also hosted many visitors, who we hope went away with a sense of the innovativeness and vigour of our local space ecosystem. Our thanks go to [Singapore Space & Technology Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company/singaporespace/), for their fantastic work in putting together the pavilion, and to [Enterprise Singapore](https://www.linkedin.com/company/enterprisesingapore/) for supporting the effort.  
  
Many kudos also to the [International Astronautical Federation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-astronautical-federation/) and [Centre National d'Études Spatiales](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cnes/) for organising and hosting a fantastic event! 👏👏👏  
  
For now, au revoir Paris 👋
