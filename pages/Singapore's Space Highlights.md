"The space sector has untold potential and possibilities. Many space technologies have found applications here on earth, like the GPS in our smartphones and cars. 

Singapore may not be a space-faring nation, but we are doing R&D in space-related capabilities to support key pillars of our economy, such as aviation and maritime. 

I hope future breakthroughs will one day help us solve pressing challenges like climate change, and improve lives."

-Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
