OSTIn’s S$150M flagship Space Technology Development Programme
(STDP) seeks to develop space capabilities to support domains such as
aviation, maritime and sustainability, which are critical to Singapore and
many other countries, as well as disruptive space technologies that can
improve the country’s space industry’s competitiveness.

Projects supported by the STDP include:

• Very low Earth orbit (VLEO) satellite technologies that would
allow satellites to operate in orbits closer to Earth and deliver
differentiated capabilities.

• Quantum key distribution (QKD) satellite solutions that would
enable quantum-safe transmission of secure information.

• Use of satellite data for applications such as carbon
measurement, reporting and verification (MRV), agriculture,
pollution monitoring.

In addition, OSTIn is exploring new opportunities emerging in the space
economy, such as on-orbit servicing, in-space manufacturing and space
life sciences, including whether Singapore’s strengths in domains like AI,
robotics, materials science and life sciences can be pivoted to support
space applications.
