Singapore is committed to nurturing a steady pipeline of future space professionals through workforce development and STEM outreach programmes in collaboration with key partners.

The Singapore Economic Development Board Industrial Postgraduate Programme (EDB-IPP) provides opportunities for postgraduate students to engage in industry-relevant research with companies, including those in the space sector. This helps students to acquire cutting-edge skills necessary for space technology development while growing the talent pipeline for the space sector.

For our youth, the Integrated Space Programme is an initiative which aims to inspire pre-tertiary students to pursue STEM education through hands-on exposure to space and satellite technology. In addition to space lessons and coursework, students have the opportunity to design and develop their own space mission, working under the guidance and mentorship of professional space engineers to build a flight-ready satellite for launch and operation in 2026.
