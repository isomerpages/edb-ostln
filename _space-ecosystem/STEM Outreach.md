Singapore is committed to nurturing a steady pipeline of future space professionals through workforce development and STEM outreach programmes in collaboration with key partners.

The Singapore Economic Development Board Industrial Postgraduate Programme (EDB-IPP) provides opportunities for postgraduate students to engage in industry-relevant research with companies, including those in the space sector. This helps students to acquire cutting-edge skills necessary for space technology development while growing the talent pipeline for the space sector.
