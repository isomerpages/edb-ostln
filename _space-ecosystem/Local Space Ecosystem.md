<p>Although Singapore's space ecosystem is relatively nascent, its growth
is accelerating and the organizations involved have made great strides
in expanding their areas of expertise. Singapore's space sector comprises
over 2,000 professionals and researchers working in over 60 companies active
in different sections of the entire value chain - from design and manufacturing
to satellite based services such as data processing.</p>
<p>For a directory of space companies in Singapore's ecosystem, please view
and download the brochure <a href="https://www.space.gov.sg/files/Singapore_Space_Industry_Directory_2025_2026_Web_Version.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
