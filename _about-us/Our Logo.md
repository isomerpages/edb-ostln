![Office for Space Technology and Industry, Singapore Logo](/images/Logos/ostin%20logo%20(navy)%203.png)
The OSTIn logo is inspired by the Singapore flag, which has five stars depicting Singapore’s ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality and a crescent moon that represents a young nation on the ascendant. 

Following the Singapore flag, OSTIn's logo has five stars accompanied by an elliptical orbit satellite featuring a crescent moon. The logo illustrates OSTIn’s mandate as the national space office. Space blue is selected as the colour of the logo to represent the outer space, which is also known as the final frontier.
