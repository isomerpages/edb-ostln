In order to capture the economic opportunities and build a thriving space industry for Singapore, the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), together with other participating ministries and agencies, established the Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn) in 2013. 

In 2020, OSTIn, led by [Executive Director David Tan](\david-tan),  received the mandate to serve as the national space office to grow a globally competitive space industry in Singapore. We collaborate closely with [local and international satellite industry players](\sg-business-directory) to realise their business and innovation initiatives for the Asian markets. With a strong focus in driving innovation, OSTIn also works closely with partners within and beyond the Singapore’s space ecosystem to develop key research capabilities and talent to enable sustainable growth of the satellite industry in Singapore. 

In addition, OSTIn operates as the national focal point to plan for all civil space matters in Singapore. As a responsible actor in space, Singapore is committed to the peaceful and sustainable use of space resources, and is a member of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). To that end, OSTIn aims to foster an enabling regulatory environment for Singapore’s space activities.
