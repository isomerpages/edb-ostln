![OSTIn Logo](/images/OSTIn-Signature-09.png)

The OSTIn logo is inspired by the Singapore flag, which has five stars depicting Singapore’s ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality and a crescent moon that represents a young nation on the ascendant. 

Following the Singapore flag, the OSTIn logo similarly has five stars, and the crescent moon is featured via the elliptical orbit of the satellite, which illustrates OSTIn’s mandate as the national space office. Space blue is selected as the colour of the logo, to represent the Earth, which is also known as the Blue Planet.
