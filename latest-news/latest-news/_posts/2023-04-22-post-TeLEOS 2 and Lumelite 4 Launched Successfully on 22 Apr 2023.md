_**Singapore, 22 April 2023**_ – ST Engineering today announced that it has launched its first polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) satellite, TeLEOS-2. Developed in partnership with Singapore’s Defence Science and Technology Agency (on behalf of Government of Singapore), TeLEOS-2 features a made-in-Singapore SAR payload and is able to capture both day and night images under all-weather conditions in high resolutions, with full polarimetry for a wider range of satellite data applications. This will enhance ST Engineering’s commercial satellite imagery solutions, providing multi-modal and high responsiveness features to its customers.

Operating in near-equatorial orbit (NEqO) at 10 degrees inclination, the satellite offers 1m high-resolution imagery with an average of 14 passes a day, offering enhanced and wider coverage of many major shipping routes, as well as disaster-prone and forest-fire regions. This provides numerous opportunities for customers in applications such as disaster monitoring and management, environmental monitoring, natural resource exploration and management, climate change and weather studies.

Notably, the PolSAR payload allows the satellite to penetrate cloud and precipitation and capture both day and night images under all-weather conditions. This also allows for improved monitoring, mapping and quantification, as well as multiparameter details of different surfaces.

“The development and launch of TeLEOS-2 represent another milestone in our journey in building up indigenous capabilities for the expansion and commercialisation of our satellite technologies. It will further propel the growth of Singapore’s space industry and strengthen ST Engineering’s position in the global space market. We continue to deepen our capabilities and expand our service offerings for key commercial applications including maritime, agriculture, environment and disaster monitoring and management,” said Low Jin Phang, President, Digital Systems, ST Engineering.

“The Office for Space Technology & Industry (OSTIn) congratulates DSTA and ST Engineering on the successful launch of TeLEOS-2. TeLEOS-2’s ability to capture images under all weather conditions, during both nighttime and daytime, at an average of 14 passes a day, unlocks multiple possibilities for commercial applications. This includes hotspot monitoring, oil spill detection, and air & maritime search & rescue operations. As DSTA and ST Engineering push the frontiers in the development of space technology here in Singapore, we look forward to seeing how these efforts will strengthen our space ecosystem.” – Mr David Tan, Executive Director, OSTIn.

The 750kg TeLEOS-2 was successfully launched at 4.50pm (Singapore time) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota, India.
